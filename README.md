## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

### Core Git Commands Mastered
```bash
git commit              # Creating commits
git branch              # Branch management
git checkout            # Switching contexts
git merge               # Combining branches
git rebase              # Reapplying commits
git cherry-pick         # Selective commit copying
git reset / git revert  # Undoing changes
git tag                 # Version marking
git describe            # Version identification
```

### Advanced Techniques
- ✨ Interactive rebasing with commit manipulation
- ✨ Complex multi-branch sequential rebasing
- ✨ Detached HEAD state navigation
- ✨ Relative reference navigation (^, ~)
- ✨ Multiple parent commit handling
- ✨ Branch force-moving and reorganization
- ✨ Untangling complex commit histories

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Level 1: Foundation
- Understanding commits as snapshots
- Branches as lightweight pointers
- Merging preserves branch history
- Rebasing creates linear history

### Level 2: Advanced Movement
- HEAD can detach from branches
- Relative references for flexible navigation
- Reset for local, revert for shared changes
- Branch manipulation with force-move

### Level 3: Work Management
- Cherry-pick for selective commit copying
- Interactive rebase for history cleanup
- Commit reordering and squashing

### Level 4: Professional Skills
- Complex cherry-picking scenarios
- Commit juggling techniques
- Tags for permanent version markers
- Git describe for version identification

### Level 5: Mastery
- Sequential multi-branch rebasing
- Navigating merge commits with multiple parents
- Untangling complex "spaghetti" histories

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

### For Learning
